## lazy-clock

a clock in the terminal, inspired by [peaclock](https://github.com/octobanana/peaclock), but since it was not availabe for windows, I had to take matters into my own hands and make one myself.

It shows live clock (with seconds as well), and the date as well.

It is mostly done, but still a WIP.

Yet to publish it on npm.

## Work left

- The clock should fit in the centre of the terminal, it is only centre aligned when the terminal is in full screen but not when i minimize it, so have to figure out a way to make it centre aligned all time.
- thinking of adding gradient and themes, mostly cosmetic stuff.
